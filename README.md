# virtual-keyboard-vanilla

Interactive Virtual Keyboard written in pure Javascript and held together by Webpack. Design is based off of the Yamaha Pianica, 37-note Melodica. To see a more updated version of this piano, visit the version made in [React](https://github.com/jmgcito/virtual-keyboard).

## Reason for existance
I ported my original Virtual Keyboard from React to Vanilla Javascript to attain a deeper understanding of how Javascript works and what makes React so special. In the end I learned that React is useful in how it makes things like bundling something I never have to think about. Converting React's simple JSX syntax and use of components into plain Javascript was not really even the difficult part. Instead, it was the tediousness of learning Webpack and getting tone.js to work with it. All in all this was a great learning experience that strengthened my skills in Javascript.
