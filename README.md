# virtual-keyboard-vanilla

Interactive Virtual Keyboard written in pure Javascript and held together by Webpack. Design is based off of the Yamaha Pianica, 37-note Melodica. This is currently the most up-to-date version of my Virtual Keyboards

## Issues / Bugs

- CSS is broken on mobile iOS devices
- Synth limited to one tone sounding off at a time. This causes a subsequently played note to be cut off when the previous key is unpressed.

## Future improvements
- Change simple synth tones to melodica sound files.
